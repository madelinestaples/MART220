week6 Update.txt
For my code, a big change I added this week was that I also included my animations to run in my image class. B
Beforehand, I only had my static images in my image class and now I have both. 
This gives me the ability to change certian elements of my static images and animations with ease. 
My static images are in an array as well which also allows for easy adjustments. 
I resized and moved my animation so that it was more visible.
